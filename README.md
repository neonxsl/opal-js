# Opal ‚Äî Apple Music API for Home Assistant

**Opal** is a lightweight Node.js service that allows Home Assistant‚Äôs iTunes integration to work seamlessly with Apple Music on macOS. It replicates the behaviour of [`itunes-api`](https://github.com/maddox/itunes-api) and exposes track metadata, playback state, and album artwork through a straightforward HTTP API.

Designed with simplicity and reliability in mind, Opal enables Home Assistant users to monitor and control Apple Music without relying on third-party cloud services.
