# Opal (Apple Music API for Home Assistant)

Opal is a lightweight Node.js service that allows **Home Assistant’s iTunes integration** to work with **Apple Music on macOS**.  
It replicates the behaviour of [`itunes-api`](https://github.com/maddox/itunes-api), exposing track metadata, playback state, and album artwork over a simple HTTP API.
